Nice place Better than some reviews give it credit for. 
Overall, the rooms were a bit small but nice. 
Everything was clean, the view was wonderful and it is very well located (the Prudential Center makes shopping and eating easy and the T is nearby for jaunts out and about the city). 
Overall, it was a good experience and the staff was quite friendly.
what a surprise What a surprise the Sheraton was after reading some of the reviews.
